Installing Cana
====================

Which Python?
-------------

The CAnA package is deeing developed and tested on Python 2.7. 
Support for Python >= 3.5 is planned for future releases. If you’d like to help us add support for Python 3, 
please get in touch through writing to the `Mário De Prá  <mariondepra@gmail.com>`__
or send us a `pull request on Github <https://github.com/depra/astertools/pulls>`__.

We recommend using the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python>`__ to ensure you have all dependencies installed.


Installing
-----------

You can get the latest stable version
`here <https://github.com/depra/cana/releases>`_. Unpack it, go into the
directory and then run the below commands. I recommend having
`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ installed.
It makes installation and uninstallation a lot easier.

Install with PyPi:

::

    pip install cana

or 

:: 

   git clone https://github.com/depra/cana.git
   cd cana
   python setup.py install
