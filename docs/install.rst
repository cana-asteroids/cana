Installing Cana
====================

Which Python?
-------------

As Python 2.7 is coming to an end, we have updated all code for Python >=3.6, and do not provide support for Python 2.


We recommend using the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ to ensure you have all dependencies installed.


Installing with pip (recommended)

If you have `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ or `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_ installed:

::

      pip install cana-asteroids


Installing the lastest version
------------------------------

You can get the current development version with:

::

      pip install git+https://github.com/cana-asteroids/cana.git
