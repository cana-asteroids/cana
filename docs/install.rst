Installing Cana
====================

Which Python?
-------------

As Python 2.7 is coming to an end, we have updated all code for Python >=3.6, and do not provide support for Python 2.


We recommend using the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ to ensure you have all dependencies installed.


Installing with pip (recommended)
---------------------------------

If you have `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ or `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_ installed:

::

      pip install cana-asteroids


Manual download and install
---------------------------

You can get the latest stable version
`here <https://github.com/depra/cana/releases>`_, or clone the repository using git:

::

      git clone https://github.com/depra/cana.git

Unpack it if necessary, and go into the directory "*cana-master*", then run the below commands on a terminal shell:

:: 

   python setup.py install


Dependencies
------------

If you have any problems with the instalation, check if all dependencies are installed.
