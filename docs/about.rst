             The CANA package arised in the context of the PRIMitive Asteroid Spectrocopic Survey (PRIMASS). As we move to make the first data release of the survey,
            we provide a package is made of a collection of methodologies and codes that were used to analyze the survey data. These methodologies are strongly focused on the spectroscopic analysis of primitive asteroids, with codes that allow calculating the spectral gradient, identifing a hydration band and performing a taxonomic clasification, but all the methodologies can be applyied or easily extended for other classes of asteroids. 
            <p>
            The aim of this package is to make the science made by PRIMASS accessible, reproductible and extendable.

            PRIMASS is an effort lead by Dr. Noemi Pinilla-Alonso (Florida Space Institute - US) and 
            Dr. Julia de Leon (Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias - Spain) to map and constrain the composition of primitive asteroids along the Solar System.
                       
            <p>
            The study of primitive asteroids is a key component to undertand the origin and nature of volatile and organic material in the early Solar System.
            These objects are leftovers of the planetary formation and have undergone little methamorphism since they accreted, therefore providing a rich source
            of information about the organic compounds  naturally  present during  the  prebiotic evolution of the asteroids and terrestrial planets, such as the Earth.
            
            <p>
            In 2010, we started a observational campaign, using several telescopes around the globe, with the goal of studying the surface of primitive asteroids at
            different locations in the asteroid main  belt, by means of visible and near-infrared spectroscopy. 
            To date we have nearly ~600 spectra of primitive asteroids that were published in more than 10 papers in the literature, and there is more to come!

            We were funded by <a href=https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/funding/planetary-data-archiving-restoration-and-tools-pda/>NASA Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools (PDART)</a>
            to organize and make the data public at the <a href=https://pds-smallbodies.astro.umd.edu/>Small Bodies Node of the Planetary Data Science (PDS-SBN)</a>. The SBN-PDS is largely 
            responsible for archiving the data pertaining to small bodies, obtained from ground-based facilities, including ground-based surveys and other mission data.  
            <p>
            We are making the first data release available by the end of 2019 with all spectroscopic data that was already published, which contain ~600 spectra of primitive 
            asteroids, from 10 families and two dynamical groups.
