.. note::

    The Cana package is a work in progress. We need **your help** to make it
    better! You can contribute by providing an feedback of your experience and sharing
    code of analysis that can be incorporated in the package.

    or send us a
    `pull request on Github <https://github.com/depra/cana/pulls>`__.

Introduction
------------

Cana is an open-source python package designed for handling the analysis of asteroids spectroscopic and spectrophotometrc data. We aim to make our science more **open** and **reproductible**. 

Don't reinvent the wheel! 
We just released an beta version! The code is currently under development, there are still many
modules we want to include.

                 The package is mainly designed for the indentification

                such as the hydration band near 0.7 microns and the turn-off point
                near the 0.5 micron region.

Get Started
------------
See the `install instructions <install.html>`_ to set up your computer and install Cana.

Once you have everything installed, we recommend you take a look at our recipes at the
`Cookbook <cookbook.html>`_, to get an idea of what cana can do. For more detailed 
documentation go to the `Documentation page <api.html>`_ to get the complete API description. 

Cana is still a work in progress, if you are have trouble getting it to work, 
or you want to give us a feedback or colaborate, you can:

* Write to `M치rio De Pr치  <mariondepra@gmail.com>`_
* Report bugs, enhancements or else through `Github <https://github.com/depra/cana/issues>`_.
